This folder contains project documentation files built by Apache Forrest.
All proposals on better XML documentation/site solution are welcome!!!

Notes:
   1) Forrest 0.8 is required. Higher versions may work,
      but experience shows that they do not follow backward compatibility...
   2) JDK 1.5 required to build forrest docs :(
      Please make sure forrest.bat is using the 1.5 version!
